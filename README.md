# OOP Project - Rehab System (Year 1)

This project is part of the Software Engineering (SE) curriculum during my first year. It demonstrates the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, including **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**. 

The system is designed to manage various types of employees and customers in a rehabilitation center, featuring user-friendly interfaces for staff roles like **cashiers, physical therapists,** and **chiropractors**.

## Key Features
- Employee and customer management
- Role-specific functionality (e.g., Cashier, Therapist, Chiropractor)
- Data persistence using text files
- User authentication with a login system

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Concepts Applied**: OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, etc.)
